      <strong>Psylocke (Elizabeth Braddock)</strong> is a fictional superhero
      appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in
      association with the X-Men. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist
      Herb Trimpe in 1976, she first appeared in the Marvel UK series Captain
      Britain. Betsy Braddock was initially a supporting character in the
      adventures of her twin brother, Captain Britain, even briefly substituting
      for him in the role, before becoming the mutant superheroine and X-Men
      member Psylocke in 1986. Originally presented as a precognitive in the
      pages of Captain Britain and then as a telepath, the character eventually
      had her mind placed in the body of the Japanese female ninja Kwannon,
      gaining many of Kwannon's martial arts skills and elements of her
      personality. Psylocke's codename, coined by the X-Men villains Mojo and
      Spiral, debuted during her introduction to the X-Men stories post–Captain
      Britain.[2] Later, Psylocke acquired the power of telekinesis. Many
      alternative versions of the character have also appeared in several comics
      series of Marvel Multiverse, as well as in various other media and
      merchandise, notably in numerous video games. The character has been
      played by Meiling Melançon in the 2006 film X-Men: The Last Stand, and by
      Olivia Munn in the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.
